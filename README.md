Recently I have been learning to draw with just HTML and CSS to express my creativity and practice my CSS skills to keep them sharp.  It has led me to find out about using the ```box-shadow``` property to create images and pixel art.

I've always had a love of pixel art, and this year 2021, I have decided to challenge myself to create some artwork.  Let's see how I improve.

I will be using a mix of the ```box-shadow``` property and HTML ```<canvas>``` element, this will allow me to try different ways of creating.  This challenge will also allow me to practice animation.

The Rotten egg - inspiration taken from Dizzy video game, created by the Oliver Twins.  I used to play Dizzy as a kid and thought I would try and pixel art him, but instead, I turned him rotten and angry.  The rotten egg is my third attempt of pixel art to CSS.  Still need a lot of practice with shading, highlighting and hue shifting, but I love pixel art and enjoying the process.

Images are made 16px x 16px but the exported png are resized at 300% (48px) and 1000% (160px) for display purposes.
