Rotten angry egg - inspiration taken from Dizzy video game, created by the Oliver Twins.  I used to play Dizzy as a kid and thought I would try and pixel art him, but instead I turned him rotten and angry.  This is my third attempt of pixel art to CSS and it's so much fun.  Still need a lot of practice with shading, hue shifting, well, and everything else, but I love pixel art.
